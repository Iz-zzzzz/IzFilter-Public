## Iz's Addon Filter Public Version
The goal of this filter is to additional block ads/annoyances on English, International, and specially Thai sites which AdGuard Base Filter doesn't block. By blocking the following :
- Ad Elements (image, link, widget)
- Annoyances elements
- Thai bet ads/domains
> This filter works perfectly with AdGuard Base Filter.
